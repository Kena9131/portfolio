            <p class="about-p">Hello! My name is Kena Sukhadia. I see myself as a motion graphics artist, graphic designer, and UX designer. Beyond my visual creations, I gravitate towards to see design in everything around me or in all I do. I think there are numerous ways to solve design issues, and I like exploring them. The relationship between inspiration, design, and technology fascinates me a lot. <br> <br> I spend the most of my time in my design world. If you don't see me in front of a colorful computer screen, you are likely to see me knitting, crocheting, sketching, or just binge-watching Friends. <br> <br> Feel free to hit me up if you have any interesting projects to discuss or just want to be friends.</p>
            <p>Let's talk Design!</p>
